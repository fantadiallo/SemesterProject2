# Pet Adoption Platform üêæ

This is my Semester Project 2 ‚Äì a responsive pet adoption website built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **Bootstrap 5**, and the **Noroff API v2**. I created both the public and admin sides of the app, where users can browse and search for pets, and logged-in users (admins) can create, edit, or delete pet listings.

Everything is connected to the live API, and I‚Äôve used localStorage for auth, custom components for modularity, and added UX features like a loader, pagination, modals, and live image previews. I also made sure the layout works well on both mobile and desktop.
